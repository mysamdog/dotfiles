# Alice's Dotfiles

My dotfiles. Not all of them are up-to-date, but emacs and zsh should be reasonably close.

## Installation

To use these dotfiles, clone the repository to your home directory, enter the directory, and use GNU Stow to create symlinks.

To use the zsh dotfile, install oh-my-zsh first.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alice157/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
stow emacs zsh```
